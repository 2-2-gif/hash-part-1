# stdlib
Contains functions for the HASH stdlib

## Developing

### TypeScript standard library

We use TypeScript to build the standard library available to Javascript behaviors in HASH.
To contribute, please install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Some useful commands:
```
# Build the standard library
npm run build

# Run the tests
npm run test
```

We use ESLint to help find errors and enforce code style. Your editor or IDE likely
has an ESLint plugin which will show these errors and warnings automatically.
Alternatively, you can run ESLint from your terminal:
```
npm run lint
```
