# Activity History

When you make changes to simulation files, create a release, or run a simulation, HASH automatically records the action and the output within the Activity sidebar. You can revisit earlier commits, and rerun a simulation and experiment with those values.

![The Activity sidebar is on the right hand side of the IDE](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

You can filter Activity to a specific type of activity.
